Now you know how serious hackers look!</p><p>One of my users sent me a link to <a href=\"https://discord.gg/NnyRtWr\" target=\"_blank\">this Discord chat</a>. And it really made my evening. By the looks of this chat I can tell that CorePacks server was hacked/or down for a several days now. And some idiots in that chat really think that hacking servers is just as easy as running a WordPress blog.</p><p>Special prize goes to someone named ARKN, he\u2019s the genius one. I guess he was molested or tortured by some dark hair girl in his childhood, and now he became obsessed. Or perverted, I don\u2019t know what happens in that cases.</p><p>But still, fun read. Scroll back the chat to read it in full.<br>As a bonus, you\u2019ll find links to CorePack repacks in there, if you\u2019re a fan \ud83d\ude42</p><p>PS: B00! Y0U\u2019VE B33N HACK3D. See, now I can even type as hackers!</p><p>PPS: If you want more fun, <a href=\"http://fitgirl-repacks.site/attack-titan-o-t-wings-freedom-dlcs/\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. ARKN decided to put a dispute with me, but missed a little (for kids it\u2019s OK to miss for the first time \ud83d\ude42</p>             </div>"
