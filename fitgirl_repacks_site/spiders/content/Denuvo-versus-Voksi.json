His PC and server were confiscated by authorities and now he needs our support. You can read the <div><a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/91t0b8/what_happened_to_revolt_and_me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">full story on Reddit</a></div>.</p><p>Since now he\u2019s alone in his fight against evil corporation, he needs our support to cover legal actions. You can donate any amount to the bitcoin address posted below. Unlike your donations to me for site hosting, this case is much more serious. So even if you didn\u2019t donate me anything, please donate this time for the cause. The guy was making free cracks for all of us, it woudn\u2019t be fair to let him down now.</p><p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Support Voksi:</span> <span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>1HyTg5YFsTbTViwoPzCCof2aLoWuPNo4Ae\u00a0</strong></span></p><p>Update: Many of you were asking if you could donate generic money, like PayPal. Voksi provided me with this address you can send your donation to: <a href=\"mailto:unknownbulgarian2@gmail.com\">unknownbulgarian2@gmail.com</a></p><p>If you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s his address, contact him directly in Discord, listed in his Reddit message.</p>             </div>"
