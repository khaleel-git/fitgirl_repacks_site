Welcome to the first-person world of a mid-level stockbroker, as you begin your very first day at the trading firm FERIOS. You\u2019ve probably wanted this job since you were six, right? Well, so have a lot of people\u2026 so you\u2019ll have to fight for it and prove that you\u2019re the top dog for the job!</p><p>Just remember: profit is all that matters, the rules don\u2019t apply if you\u2019re a winner, and only losers feel guilty for the pain, loss and poverty that are the unfortunate but unavoidable by-product of the critical and important work we do here.</p><p><b>The Family Office Update:</b></p><p><b>NOTHING SUCCEEDS LIKE SUCCESS.</b><br>As a trader, you\u2019ve amassed enough wealth for FERIOS that somebody in the Miller Family Office has decided to retain you as their personal financial advisor. Will you fail miserably, or will you be so successful that even more powerful and shadowy members of the family make you their golden goose instead?</p><p>In this update to The Invisible Hand, explore a new and improved Endless Mode that will allow you to gradually control entire percentages of the global economy on behalf of the wealthiest people nobody has ever heard of.</p><p>As an Endless Mode player, your options are immeasurable. Do you have what it takes to make the numbers so big that it forces us to patch the game to allow for even bigger numbers? Can you delay our future projects and ruin our lives for the sake of a pointless abstraction? Can you test the implied warranty of the word \u2018endless\u2019 for some indecipherable purpose? The choice is yours.</p><p>Of course, Endless Mode will be accessible to all players who purchase The Invisible Hand whether they begin by playing through the original campaign or not \u2013 just don\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.</p><p><b><h3>Game Features</h3></b></p><ul><li><b>Buy, Sell, and Short:</b> It\u2019s simple: your job is to make money for FERIOS. Buy the stocks going up, sell before they go down. Short the ones that are going to fall (or the ones you\u2019re going to make fall). The more money you make, the bigger your commission. And you want that commission, don\u2019t you? Well don\u2019t worry, the rewards are limitless, if you\u2019re hungry enough.</li><li><b>Manipulate the Market:</b> If you\u2019re really smart, you\u2019ll find ways to influence the market to your advantage. Think you can lobby an influential group to affect the market? Do it. Get an opportunity to acquire majority shares to move the needle? Take it. Drive down the currency of a foreign country to improve the margins of the companies that import their products? Why not? The only consequences that matter are the ones that impact our bottom line.</li><li><b>It\u2019s not insider trading if you don\u2019t get caught!:</b> Every Joe Schmo has access to the regular news. If you want to get ahead of the spikes and crashes you\u2019ll need to find the inside line from more, shall we say, \u201cexclusive\u201d sources. And definitely don\u2019t let those rumors of a financial investigation get you down. No one employed by FERIOS has ever been found guilty!</li><li><b>You\u2019re a Winner! Who cares about Losers?:</b> We\u2019re one big happy team here at Ferios and nothing brings the team together like competition. So in the spirit of togetherness you better meet your daily profit targets and beat your coworkers\u2019 results if you want to keep your job. We won\u2019t hesitate to fire anyone who can\u2019t or won\u2019t do what it takes to succeed\u2026</li><li><b>Imagine all the rewards that await you:</b> The fruits of success are yours for the taking. Fast cars, lavish parties, fancy apartments filled with beautiful furniture and artworks. Of course, for any truly successful trader, work is its own reward and their true home is the office so it\u2019s a good thing you can decorate your desk with photos of all your wonderful things to remind you they exist.</li></ul></div></div>             </div>"
