So this fix is good only if you already have my repack. But if you didn\u2019t get the game yet, wait for tomorrow, when I will release an updated repack with the same installation time, as before, but without this bug. It will be mostly backwards compatible, ~23 GB will be rehasheable with initial repack.</p><p><del datetime=\"2016-09-25T01:10:27+00:00\">If you already got my NBA 2K17 repack, you could already get the notorious \u201cUnsupported stream type\u201d error. While I was doing my tests (I installed the game 5 times), I never experienced this bug. However, after I\u2019ve received so many claims, I\u2019ve concluded more manual tests. In some of them this bug actually appeared for me too. As far as I can tell now, it\u2019s VERY random. You may catch at the beginning, in the middle or in the end of the installation. Or you will get lucky and won\u2019t catch it at all. Users of SSD have the lowest chance, I guess.</del></p><p><del>I don\u2019t like when my repacks don\u2019t work for that many people. This particular bug will be fixed ASAP. I will change the restoration method, which doesn\u2019t use \u201cprecomp.inside\u201d functionality at all. There is a drawback \u2013 the installation will be slower. I can\u2019t tell for how long yet.</del></p><p><del>The fix for current repack will be small in size and will be released ASAP, probably tomorrow. If the installation will become slow for a huge amount of time, the updated, backwards compatible repack will be released as well.</del></p><p>Sorry for inconvenience, errors happen.</p>             </div>"
