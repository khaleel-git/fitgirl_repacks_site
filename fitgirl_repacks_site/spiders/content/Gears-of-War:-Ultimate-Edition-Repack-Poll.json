There is a crack from other game, which works with GoW: UE, but there is one major bug \u2013 the game doesn\u2019t save. And it\u2019s unlikely it will ever be fixed, since the game uses Xbox Cloud for storing save files. There is a workaround about this issue \u2013 checkpoint saves for all actual checkpoints in the game. And you can \u201cload\u201d any significant place in the game at any moment. So the poll question is this: should I make a repack with this workaround or wait for infinity for a proper crack to appear?</p><p><script type=\"text/javascript\">(function(d, s, id){  var js,      fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],      r = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000000);  if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async=1;  js.src = \"https://www.opinionstage.com/assets/loader.js?\" + r;  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'os-widget-jssdk'));</script></p><div class=\"os_poll\" data-path=\"/polls/2553738\" id=\"os-widget-545590\"></div>             </div>"
