Yep, that\u2019s right. No more Ubisoft games and repacks from now on (until Denuvo will be properly cracked, of course).</p><p>Update: <del datetime=\"2016-08-04T21:14:01+00:00\">In Uplay an updated Heroes VII version goes WITHOUT DENUVO. WHAT. THE. FUCK. is in the heads of Ubisoft, huh?</del>. The game is not updated in Uplay, so it will have Denuvo most def.</p>             </div>"
