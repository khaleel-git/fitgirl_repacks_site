It\u2019s pretty disturbing entertainment, but somehow I like to watch them.</p><p>An example video:<br><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOw1vct-wHg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Most of those call-centers are located in India and Bangladesh. So I want to ask my users from these countries \u2013 what to you think of those scammers? Is it a respectable job? What people think of them? How lying and stealing money fits into karma concept? No offence, I\u2019m just curious. Want to listen to as many opinions as possible.</p><p>Update: Thanks to everybody, who participated in the discussion \u2013 I have a full spectrum of opinions now. If someone felt offended by questions I\u2019ve asked \u2013 please don\u2019t be, I didn\u2019t mean harm when asking. Just pure quriocity based on information I had before. Since this topic became pretty toxic and even racist, I\u2019m closing it for new comments.</p><p>Update 2:<br>Wish I would\u2019ve find it earlier:</p><p><strong>What is it like to work in an tech support scam call center?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-in-an-tech-support-scam-call-center\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-work-in-an-tech-support-scam-call-center</a></p>             </div>"
