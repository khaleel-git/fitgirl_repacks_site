I use it for many years and it\u2019s an absolute must for anyone, who is using the PC for anything but Word/Excel. ESPECIALLY for those, who play games and install heavy repacks.</p><p>This software is called Process Lasso and it\u2019s not unique of it\u2019s kind, there are similar ones, you can google them. But I personally tried a few of them and still think PL is the best.</p><p>So, what does ot basically do? It allows running of any application with a set priority/CPU affinity and KEEPING them that way. While foreground applications get the higher priority. What does it mean for you as a user? It means that you can, say, installing my repack while having no problems with browsing, watching videos, etc.</p><p>Process Lasso have a whole lot of other features \u2013 you can read some reviews or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Lasso\">Wikipedia</a>. But really, stop and <a href=\"https://bitsum.com/\">download</a> it already. It\u2019s free and only nags you sometimes with a proposal of buying the full version.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-10605 size-full\" src=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/process-lasso-screenshot-02.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"875\" height=\"742\" srcset=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/process-lasso-screenshot-02.png 875w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/process-lasso-screenshot-02-300x254.png 300w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/process-lasso-screenshot-02-768x651.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px\"></p>             </div>"
