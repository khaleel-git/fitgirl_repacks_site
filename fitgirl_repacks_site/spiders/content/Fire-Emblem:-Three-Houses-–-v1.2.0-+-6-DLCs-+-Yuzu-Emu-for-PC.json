Lead the students of one of three prestigious houses through their academic lives and in tactical, turn-based battles filled with new, strategic twists to overcome.</p><p>The continent of Fodlan is divided by three ruling nations, and at its centre lies Garreg Mach Monastery, home to the Officers Academy where the future leaders of Fodlan train. As a travelling mercenary turned teacher, you must choose which of the Academy\u2019s three houses to lead in their academic lives and on the battlefield.</p><p>The future of Fodlan rests on your decision\u2026</p><p>Class assignments will see you and your pupils charge into strategic, turn-based skirmishes across Fodlan. In a series first, battalions of troops will follow your units to support them on the battlefield. How your students fare in these battles depends on your leadership, so strategise as the fight progresses to lead your army to victory.</p><p>Nurture your pupils\u2019 talents and help them reach their full potential at the Officers Academy. Freely roam the grounds of the Garreg Mach Monastery between lectures to undertake assignments and get to know your students to increase your bond with them and gather useful intel.</p><p><b>Included DLCs</b></p><ul><li>Additional Quests</li><li>Additional Support Items</li><li>Auxiliary Battle Maps</li><li>New Attire</li><li>Officers Academy Uniform Byleth</li><li>Side Story: Cindered Shadows</li></ul></div></div><div ><div Known Issues and Fixes</div><div ><ul><li>Both Chapter 15 \u2013 Valley of Torment and Chapter 17 \u2013 Blood of the Eagle and Lion (as well as two missions in story DLC) cause an unskippable cutscene crash. To circumvent this issue you need to transfer your save files to old Yuzu v41 (located in yuzu041 folder). Run Yuzu 41, turn GPU settings to async off, load the mission with this version and then save when in battle preparation and copy the save back to the current yuzu</li><li>Random occasional crashes. Savescum liberally (you can do this on maddening classic too, by copying the two files created when you make a bookmark, and paste and replace if you want to load the bookmark at any time)</li><li>When you win a battle it will softlock fairly often when it is supposed to load the save menu. As a workaround, create a bookmark right before finishing the battle and then load the bookmark, as the issue seems to stem from the game running for too long on a map. It will often softlock with a black screen when creating the bookmark but that is after creating the bookmark so if you restart the game you can load the bookmark and finish the battle.</li><li>Memory leak will cause the game to crash after about an hour in any map.</li><li>Voice lines have reverberation issues (in versions 488 and 41)</li></ul></div></div>             </div>"
