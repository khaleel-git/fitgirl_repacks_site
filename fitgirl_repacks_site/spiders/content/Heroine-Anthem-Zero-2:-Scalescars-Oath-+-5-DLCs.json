the seven doomsday. When the lands were flooded on the sixth doomsday, after the descendants of the Savior received blessings from God, they resurrected under the new born Tree of Life Terasyr, establishing the royal city of Vuzahem. But ichthyopagion still continued to grow, making clear that the Gods have not forgiven the world. People must find answers to the meaning of war while surviving the sins and punishments before Judgement Day. The story includes multiple subtle metaphors for the relationship between God and humans.</p><p>The game revolves around Shama, the young descendent of Gon Arrue who survived ichthyopagion. Living under the Tree of Life and becoming a priestess, then leaving the Tree of Life on the eve of the Star Ark Festival, she traveled to the far west to Uzato, the town of the Forest Keepers. She goes looking for the benefactor her mother told her of in hopes of finding an ordinary and simple home, but the only clue her mother left was a pin. What has Shama been through? Keeping her tears and loneliness secret behind her smile, leaving the place she promised to look for. But will her fate truly bring her peace?</p><p><b>About the game:</b><br>Heroine Anthem ZERO 2 : Scalescars Oath is a real time 2D mixed with 3D side-scrolling story-based ARPG, simultaneously supporting controller and keyboard input.
