In Football Manager 2021, dynamic, true-to-life management experiences and next-level detail renews that focus on you, the manager, equipping you with all the tools you need to achieve elite status.<p>With more than 50 nations and 2,500 clubs at every level of the football pyramid to choose from, the possibilities are endless. It\u2019s over to you, boss.</p><p><b>Interaction</b><br>Communicating with your players and the media has never been more purposeful or realistic. Gestures enable you to express every emotion, while Quick Chats improve those short, informal conversations which are part of day-to-day life as a manager. In FM21, others will feel the impact of your words and know the sort of manager you are.</p><p><b>Matchday</b><br>Every fixture now feels like a true spectacle with our best-looking match engine ever. You\u2019ll receive better analysis and advice in the pre-match build-up and those data improvements combine with our remodelled match UI to bring you closer to the action than ever before.</p><p>FM21 also boasts a raft of AI improvements across every area of the pitch. The rate of decision-making has increased and there\u2019s more nuance to the decisions that players make, allowing them to be more reactive and make faster decisions. This improved decision-making process has enabled better defensive and goalkeeper intelligence, enhanced central play and more variety in the final third.</p><p>Additionally, you\u2019ll also get more reaction and data post-match, including our brand new SIxG system, which will let you know well or badly your team performed relative to the chances they created.</p><p><b>Analysis and Stats</b><br>Our extensive data improvements go beyond Matchdays, giving you all the tools to level up your pre-match preparations. Managers benefit from a vastly increased amount of data reporting and visualisation this year, including monthly reports from the new Performance Analyst that mirrors the data real managers receive. New graphs and data maps provide clearer insight into their team\u2019s strengths and opposition weaknesses, while there\u2019s a wealth of new stats that will give you full statistical overview of the entire pitch.</p><p><b>Recruitment</b><br>New staff roles, meetings and interactions freshen up one of the game\u2019s most popular areas. Recruitment meetings now ensure that you and your scouting team are on the same page, both for your next moves and the club\u2019s longer-term strategy in the transfer market. Moreover, you\u2019ll now be able to approach agents directly about a player\u2019s interest in joining your club.</p><p><b>End of Season</b><br>Re-live your campaigns and revel in your success like never before. A new season review presentation picks out your best moments on and off the pitch, while showpiece victories feel much sweeter with improved title presentations and masses of media attention.</p><p>This is a game that rewards planning and knowledge but there\u2019s no pre-defined ending or script to follow, simply endless opportunities. Every club has a story to tell and it\u2019s up to you to write it.</p><p><b><h3>Game Features</h3></b></p><ul><li>Choose your colours and the challenge that best suits your ambitions and then work with your club\u2019s hierarchy to ensure you meet theirs\u2026 or face the consequences.</li><li>Join forces with your backroom staff to assess the strength and depth of your playing squad before dipping into the transfer market. There\u2019s likely to be a starlet in your Academy knocking on the door of the first team\u2026</li><li>Craft tactical strategies, formations and styles of play for every occasion to maximise your club\u2019s chances of winning football matches and getting those three points.</li><li>Immerse yourself in the spectacle of match day and revel in the glory of management as your planning pays off on the pitch.</li></ul></div></div><div ><div Included Mods</div><div ><p>Please note that even if you select any included mod for the installation, it simply will unpack, but WILL NOT install in game, you should make it manually to avoid conflicts with other mods and game configuration.</p><p>Check instructions for every mode in their respective \u201c_MODS\u201d subfolders after installation.</p><p><b>FMI Data Update 21.11</b></p><p>Official page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fminside.net/downloads/fmi-update/281-fmi-update-2111\" rel=\"noopener\">https://fminside.net/downloads/fmi-update/281-fmi-update-2111</a></p><ul><li>This update includes every promotion and relegation for every playable league in Football Manager 2021.</li><li>ALL squads are up to date as of July 30th 2021 (including the latest transfers)</li><li>ALL leagues are updated with teams for 2021/2022 season</li></ul><p><b>Real Names Licence Fix</b></p><p>Official page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm21-real-names-license-fix.html\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.fmscout.com/a-fm21-real-names-license-fix.html</a></p><ul><li>All playable clubs names from all continents</li><li>All major leagues names</li><li>All non-playable Europe Top Leagues club names</li><li>Almost all minor leagues names</li><li>All Continental, National and National Cups names</li><li>Continental awards</li><li>Some stadium names</li></ul><p><b>TCM21 \u2013 Logopack FM2021</b></p><p>Official page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.tcmlogos.com/tcm21-logos-fm21/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tcmlogos.com/tcm21-logos-fm21/</a></p><p>Megapack of more 61,700 clubs and competitions logos for Football Manager 2021</p><p><b>The Legends Of The Beautiful Games</b></p><p>Official page: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://df11faces.com/LOTBG-FM2021\" rel=\"noopener\">https://df11faces.com/LOTBG-FM2021</a></p><p>With this extra data-set the most legendary players from football history will appear in your Football Manager game.
