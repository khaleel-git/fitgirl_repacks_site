With this topic I want to see if anyone in the world is interested in learning stuff about Russia and Russian people via cinematic experience.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with a comedy. It\u2019s titled \u201cThe Irony of Fate, or Enjoy Your Bath!\u201d (\u0418\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0443\u0434\u044c\u0431\u044b, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0421 \u043b\u0451\u0433\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043f\u0430\u0440\u043e\u043c!) and it was released in 1976, long before my birth. Yet me and millions of other Russian-speaking people watch it every year on a New Year\u2019s eve. It\u2019s kinda premature to show it to you in November, yet it\u2019s a good start. It\u2019s a comedy \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to spoil you the story.</p><p>It consists of two series and has subtitles in Russian, English, Spanish, French and Bulgarian.</p><p>Videos are not embeddable, so here are the links to YouTube:<br>Part 1: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVpmZnRIMKs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVpmZnRIMKs</a><br>Part 2: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TmGPeowN-0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TmGPeowN-0</a><br>Magnet: <a href=\"magnet:?xt=urn:btih:415297CD8B2369483E1F5C6A65F4C1677CD9BD25&amp;tr=http%3A%2F%2Fbt3.t-ru.org%2Fann%3Fmagnet\">magnet:?xt=urn:btih:415297CD8B2369483E1F5C6A65F4C1677CD9BD25</a></p><p>Let me know in comments if this format is interesting for you, how you find this flick and should I continue this in the future or stick to my repacks \ud83d\ude42</p><p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Update: So, looks like you people are really interested in that part of the Russian culture. Expect weekly posts with my recommendations for Russian movies and animations.</span></p>             </div>"
