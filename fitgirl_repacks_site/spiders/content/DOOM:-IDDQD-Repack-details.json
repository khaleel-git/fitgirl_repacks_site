But since I don\u2019t like the idea of ripping and prefer to give YOU a choice, I\u2019ve managed to make not a rip, but a proper new repack, which allows you to download the game in any form you like \u2013 with or without MP and/or SnapMap, as I did with giant Black Ops 3 repack.</p><p>And I didn\u2019t spent my time for nothing. Here are the features of upcoming <span style=\"color: #800000;\"><strong>DOOM IDDQD Repack</strong></span> (named after an infamous cheat code in original DOOM, which gave you a God Mode).</p><div style=\"clear: both; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;\"></div><ul><li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Smallest lossless rip/repack in the world</strong></span>: the minimum size is just 27.6 GB, while complete game with Credits/MP/SnapMap is 38.3 GB, 400 MBs smaller, then the previous repack.</li><li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Faster installation</strong></span>. Installation time reduced by 10-50%, depending on your hardware. Optimized compression and lower HDD load as a free bonus \ud83d\ude42</li><li><span style=\"color: #008000;\"><strong>Selective download</strong></span> of optional components: Multiplayer files (for possible future cracks/servers/whatever), SnapMap (so you can create maps if you wish), and Credits video (contains spoilers!). Of course, language selection is intact, as always. Only Premium Service for my dear users \ud83d\ude42</li></ul><p>There is only one downside with new IDDQD Repack. It\u2019s absolutely <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">backwards incompatible</span> with initial repack due to changed compression scheme and new selective download options.</p><p>As for delivery time. I hope to release it tomorrow. But if you already downloaded the first repack, there is no need for a new one. Only if you want to replace the old with new in your collection.</p>             </div>"
