After a couple of days, harvest your crops and then cook them up or wrap them in a bouquet to sell in your shop.</p><p>Keep an eye out for those lovely rainy days, or craft some sprinklers so you can spend your time doing other tasks without worrying about your crops withering away.</p><p><b>FISHING!</b><br>There is water everywhere! So it\u2019s no surprise that the villagers on these islands like to fish.

We enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoy working on it and there will be a lot more content coming in the future.</p></div></div>             </div>"
