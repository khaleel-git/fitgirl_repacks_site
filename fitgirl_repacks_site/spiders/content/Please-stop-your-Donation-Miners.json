Currently Monero has switched to a new hashing algo and the current build of WinXMR which I used before doesn\u2019t support it yet. So if you\u2019re running it right now \u2013 please stop and wait for news from me. If it will be updated, I will make a special announcement. Until then the only possible way to donate is only <div><a href=\"http://fitgirl-repacks.site/donations/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">via traditional cryptocurrency transaction</a></div>. Thanks again for supporting the just cause!</p>             </div>"
