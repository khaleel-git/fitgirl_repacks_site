Work with basic items such as paint rollers, spray cans, crowbars and repair wrenches or use your in-game tablet to order new materials and items.

In addition to money needed to buy new items and repair materials, you can also benefit by segregating waste or completing additional tasks.</li><li><b>Build your own station:</b> Thanks to the station decoration system, you will be able to create the internal and external appearance of various facilities yourself. You can add benches, vending machines, kiosks, and other items as needed, and place them wherever you want. Thanks to this function, you will quickly turn a dump into a great looking ready for business train station.</li><li><b>The possibility of expanding the game:</b> The game will be supported after launch, with patches and new official content released addressing needs that the community puts forward. The game will be open for user submitted mods.</li></ul></div></div><p><b>Backwards Compatibility</b></p><p>This repack IS NOT backwards compatible with my previous TSR repack.</p>             </div>"
