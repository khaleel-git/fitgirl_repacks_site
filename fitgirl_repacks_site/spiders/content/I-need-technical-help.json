For some reasons almost all scripts on site return 403 error, including ones inside the post editor. I could barely create this single post due to .js return 403 errors. And yes, I\u2019ve checked all read/write rules on files and folders (they are correct \u2013 755/644). I\u2019ve also tried to disable and re-enable all plugins one by one \u2013 nothing changes. I\u2019ve tried to edit .htaccess \u2013 it doesn\u2019t help even when absolutely clean.</del></p><p><del>For the same reason some of you can\u2019t use search and experience slow site loading.</del></p><p><del>So if you have experience with such problems or know a person who can help me, I\u2019d really appreciate it.</del></p><p><del>Please contact me on <a href=\"http://cs.rin.ru/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=553522\">cs.rin.ru</a>.</del></p>             </div>"
