Unfortunately, this is a \u201cfeature\u201d of the DigitalPush service, which I\u2019m testing.</p><p>DigitalPush service has three plans \u2013 one is free, but it can/should send no more than 2 ads per week per user. Two others are: a) \u201cPay for\u201d, in which I have to pay $0.49 for every 1000 of subscribers per month; b) \u201cRevenue share\u201d, which gives the owner 85% of revenue but shows 1-4 ads per day per subscriber. </p><p>Obviously, I\u2019m using the 1st one. I myself received one ad today already. And I will keep an eye if they follow their own rules (2 ads per week). If they don\u2019t \u2013 I will turn notification service off.</p><p>Meanwhile, I\u2019d be happy to find some other way of notification, which would be free and didn\u2019t contain any ads. If you know such way \u2013 please let me know in comments.</p><p>I hate ads myself, but some of them come with free services like DigitalPush or Disqus as an obligation.</p>             </div>"
