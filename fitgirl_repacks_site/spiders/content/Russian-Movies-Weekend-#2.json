It\u2019s pretty rare one, cause it was made for television only and the release has happened just one year before the USSR disappearance. I don\u2019t want to spoil you the story and urge you not to google it. If you like Andrei Tarkovsky vision, this flick looks pretty similar and for me was a scary experience. Please don\u2019t forget to share your opinion in the comments.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HNlLphhwkkA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqRBIS_VOBY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe><br><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ndEPZRvVjJo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><h3>Armenian Animation</h3><p>Those short animations were made in early 80x by \u201cArmenfilm\u201d studio. Armenia was a part of the Soviet Union then, so these movies are considered as a Soviet Heritage. I must say that those cartoons are not mainstream, but I hope you\u2019ll love them, like I do.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmB4DfG-3K4\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmF_imBU9nE\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBA2Ort06nc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p><p>There are more like this, probably someone will share those in comments.</p>             </div>"
