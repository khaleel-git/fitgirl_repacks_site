And I hate \u2019em. The last one was made more than a year ago, when the incoming donations question raised high. The same situation happens again. A few months ago my mining donations has been stopped, and now it seems to be\u00a0 gone permanently. So the only way I can accept donations returned back to the roots \u2013 <div><a href=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/donations/\">classic crypto transactions</a></div>.</p><p>In 2019 year I had to switch to a more powerful hosting due to increased site traffic and had to lease another, more powerful seedbox. Unfortunately, just a tiny little small percentage of people actually donate something. Then we see copycat sites like fitgirl-repacks.cc and fitgirlrepacks.co, which simply use my design, my posts etc., but they have replaced my BTC/ETH/\u2026 donation addresses to their own. And some poor souls just send them their money w/o knowing they are feeding the crooks.</p><p>Long story short \u2013 that stash that was accumulated via donation mining and direct donations for a year is almost depleted now.</p><p>And, this post is, like, BUMP. So if you have free money you could donate to the cause \u2013 proceed to my <a href=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/donations/\">Donation page</a> and see the ways you can financially make this site running. Even if you don\u2019t have any crypto \u2013 there are easy ways of buying it. Especially when BTC is on the rise and you can make some %$ in the future \ud83d\ude42</p><h2>A Call for Donations</h2><ul><li>No, I can\u2019t accept money donations via PayPal and similar services. Guess why.</li><li>No, I won\u2019t run any ads on my site. Probably I could place a small seedbox company ads in exchange for a powerful seedboxes, but I never received such proposals \ud83d\ude42</li></ul><p>And once again my \u201cThank you!\u201d goes not only to people who help to seed and mirror my repacks (you know who you are, guys :), but to those who help me cover costs for supporting this site. I don\u2019t know your names, but you help everyone here. Thank you.</p>             </div>"
