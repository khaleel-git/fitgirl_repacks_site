The size and ETA for release are unknown yet. You have to wait for another smallest repack, you know \ud83d\ude42</p><p>Delay in repack release is due to my attempts to make voiceovers selectable, like with my other MULTI-repacks. But MEC has very complex resource structure, so testing of injected files takes much time.</p><p>Update: Unfortunately, the game verifies internal checksums with SHA-1 hashcode, so ripping lang files makes it loading forever. The final size of the repack with all languages is <span style=\"color: #3366ff;\"><strong>16.7 GB</strong></span>. Coming today.</p>             </div>"
