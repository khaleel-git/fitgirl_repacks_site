You\u2019ve helped me a lot with the first decompression test (and you already have new repacks with new fast and efficient algo). But now I need MORE, haha \ud83d\ude42</p><p>This particular decompression test is a <b>stress</b> one. The main purpose of it is to determine how good my future repacks will install when PC is low on RAM or have RAM very fragmented.</p><p>Download these RARs:</p><p><a href=\"http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/O1qBRcH1/file.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/O1qBRcH1/file.html</a><br><a href=\"http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/p5z2JW3F/file.html\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/p5z2JW3F/file.html</a><br><a href=\"http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/w7lb7RH9/file.html\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/w7lb7RH9/file.html</a><br><a href=\"http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/NaoMIKqp/file.html\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www92.zippyshare.com/v/NaoMIKqp/file.html</a></p><p>Unpack them and run <strong>setup-ram-test-1.exe</strong> &amp; <strong>setup-ram-test-2.exe</strong> one after another (order doesn\u2019t matter). Write down installation times.</p><p>Then you have to create a low/fragmented RAM stress situation on your PC. It\u2019s not that easy task as it seems. Well, you can easily EAT RAM, but make it fragmented\u2026</p><p>So, if you\u2019re really into test \u2013 do the following.</p><ol><li>OPTIONAL \u2013 Disable page file (swap/virtual memory) \u2013 you will need to restart your PC</li><li>Open Task Manager and switch to Perfomance Tab, see \u201cPhysical Memory\u201d block?</li><li>Run as many different apps as possible. Chrome with lots of plugins and open tabs would be great. The more different memory-eating apps you have \u2013 the better. Several games would be nice too. Even antivirus (which I hate) would be a good addition, cause it\u2019s checks fragmentise the memory</li><li>Your target here is to lower \u201cAvailable\u201d to 512 Mb or less</li><li>If you launched everything you could think of \u2013 go to \u201cRAM Eater x64\u201d or \u201cRAM Eater x86\u201d folder unpacked along with test files and run one or more BAT-s. Start with 512 MB ones, eating your RAM chunk by chunk. You can run as many bats as you want. To stop any BAT from eating, just press CTRL+C or close the CMD window</li><li>When your system will become slow and poorly responsive \u2013 it\u2019s time to run the installers again</li></ol><p>Write down the results of installations, even if one or both of them will crash. It\u2019s important!</p><p><b>Report sample</b></p><p>CPU: Intel i5 6600<br>RAM: 16 GB<br>Pagefile: 16 GB<br>Test 1 Normal Installation Time: 1:10<br>Test 2 Normal Installation Time: 0:54<br>Test 1 Stress Installation Time: 2:56<br>Test 2 Stress Installation Time: crashed (crc error)</p>             </div>"
