born.<br>People from the clan worshipped insects.<br>Which help to create instruments to dispel evil beings.<br>In each generation, a girl from the clan would swallow a special insect.<br>The insect

I\u2019ve lived for 5844 days. All those days were just the preparation for today.<br>In our village, people believed that three Hun and seven Po made a person complete. If one had been invaded by Evil Gu, he would gradually lose all the seven Po and became a horrible Spirit Loser. Once all seven Po had been consumed, a new Malicious Ghost was born. And it meant new disasters. Luckily, Gu Ladies, including mom, had ways to purify the poor souls.</p><p>My mom, Wang Anru, was the last Gu Lady in the village. But she was missing ten years ago all of a sudden. For the past ten years, villagers lived without the protection of Gu Lady. On the land, people suffered a lot from plague and ghosts.</p><p>My sister Gu Jiuyue and I never stopped missing mom.

We just followed Jiuyue to enter the General\u2019s Grave and watched something really, really horrible. A giant insect leg quickly stretched out and pulled Jiuyue into the Grave!<br>Oh my! Sister\u2026 Jiuyue!!!</p><p>No! If misfortunes must happen, I\u2019d like to take it myself without getting you involved!<br>Grandpa worried about Jiuyue so much, he rushed into the grave. Though he was once the hunter leader in the clan, a trap triggered once he entered the grave.</p><p>Grandpa, Jiuyue. Hold on! I\u2019ll get you out! I\u2019ll save everyone!
