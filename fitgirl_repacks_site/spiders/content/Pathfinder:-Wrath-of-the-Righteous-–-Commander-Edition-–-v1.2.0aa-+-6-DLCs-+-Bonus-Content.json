Story</b><br>Your path will lead you to the Worldwound, where the opening of a rift to the Abyss has unleashed all-consuming terror across the land. For over a century, the neighboring nations have fought fearlessly, trying to drive the enemy back \u2014 but to little avail.<p>Now, you have the chance to put an end to this conflict, but the path to salvation is far from clear-cut. Will you become a shining angel, backed by noble paladins? Or a powerful necromancer with hordes of immortal undead in your thrall? Or something else entirely? Lead your army and challenge mighty demon lords. Your crusade will set in motion a chain of events that will leave you \u2014 and the world itself \u2014 forever changed.</p><p><b>The Inevitable Excess DLC:</b><br>This DLC will take players on a new adventure set just before their triumphant victory over the Worldwound. The new story will require all the hero\u2019s high-level abilities and mythic powers to battle nigh on invincible opponents.</p><p>Players will answer the call of Valmallos, a powerful being from another plane of existence who is determined to stop an impending threat to the universe.</p><p><b>The Inevitable Excess DLC introduces the following features:</b></p><ul><li>Play a new story that complements the main campaign storyline and takes+C27 about 7\u20138 hours. Import your character from the main campaign with all their companions, or create a new one to find out what exactly has troubled the keeper of magic.</li><li>At the beginning of the adventure, your character will have a high level \u2014 both standard and mythic. Fight new mythic opponents who threaten the peace of the planes. Use your entire arsenal of mythic abilities!</li><li>Visit Axis \u2014 the birthplace and home of the inevitables, the machine aeons, exploring every corner of this plane and finding your way through a dungeon full of dangers.</li><li>Export your achievements to the main campaign! After you complete this DLC, new powers will become available to your character in the main campaign right before the official start of the Fifth Crusade.</li><li>New opponents await you, ready to test your righteous wrath. But remember, not everything may be as it seems at first glance. Sometimes friends can betray you, and old enemies lend a helping hand.</li></ul><p><b><h3>Game Features</h3></b></p><ul><li><b>PLAY YOUR HERO, YOUR WAY:</b> Create any character imaginable with the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder First Edition ruleset. Choose from 25 classes, 12 character races, and more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities to suit your personal playstyle.</li><li><b>FOR EVERY CHOICE, A CONSEQUENCE:</b> Your decisions have more weight than ever before.

Use them wisely!</li><li><b>GATHER YOUR PARTY:</b> A cast of more than 10 unique companions is ready to join your cause. Earn their trust and respect, and they will have your back no matter what dangers lie ahead. And if you get on their bad side, well\u2026 Maybe it\u2019s time to part ways.</li><li><b>LEAD THE CRUSADE:</b> You will need much more than a party of adventurers to cleanse the land of its demonic scourge.

Your decisions might transform you into a celestial Angel, a raging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, an otherworldly Aeon, a rebellious Azata, a wise Gold Dragon, an insatiable Swarm That Walks \u2014 or remain mortal and walk the arduous path toward becoming a living Legend.</li></ul><p><b>Included DLCs:</b></p><ul><li>Commander Pack</li><li>Faces of War</li><li>Love Beyond Death</li><li>Paint of War</li><li>A Visitor from Distant Lands</li><li>Inevitable Excess</li></ul><p>* Season Pass is not a DLC, so it\u2019s not included in the list</p></div></div><p><b>Backwards Compatibility</b></p><p>This repack IS slightly backwards compatible with my previous PWotR repack.
