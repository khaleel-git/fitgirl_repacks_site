The thing is, that game resources are encrypted, thus normal compression is not possible. The only option is to split the game so you wouldn\u2019t download commentary packs for languages you don\u2019t need. The total saving is really tiny. The minimum size of such repack is 28.9 GB. But there is a bright sight too \u2013 it installs in mere 8-10 minutes from HDD to HDD. So, here\u2019s my poll. The minimum required votes percentage for posting the repack in \u201cas-is state\u201d is qualified majority of 66%.</p><p>Mind you, that if the encryption problem will be solved, I will release a normal repack with proper compression, and not this crappy monkey job.</p><p><script type=\"text/javascript\">(function(d, s, id){  var js,      fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],      r = Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / 1000000);  if (d.getElementById(id)) {return;}  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.async=1;  js.src = \"https://www.opinionstage.com/assets/loader.js?\" + r;  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'os-widget-jssdk'));</script></p><div class=\"os_poll\" data-path=\"/polls/2529334\" id=\"os-widget-2529334\"></div>             </div>"
