Also I hope that current Voksi and CODEX cracks will still work on it, haha.</p><p>Current repack size is 18.3~18.5 GB, depending on selected language. Not very small, but the game has 10 GBs of movies and ~6 GBs of audio. Everything else goes to models, animation and textures. So one can guess, why the game is so blurry and why it can\u2019t be fixed by any patch. They simply made it with year 2000 textures. Most of them do not exceed 512\u00d7512 pixels in resolution. Meh.</p><p>And yes, just like with Mafia 2, you\u2019ll get my \u201cExclusive DLC\u201d with pinups, Playboy covers and artworks, taken from game resources \ud83d\ude42</p>             </div>"
