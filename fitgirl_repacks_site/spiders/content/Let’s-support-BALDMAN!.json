NieR Automata, Prey, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 and now RiME. The guy is like a one-man-CPY, which is great! Also, his support of Prey, in example, shows, how fast he can crack updated Denuvo protection versions.</p><p>In his supporting .NFO file he humbly <a href=\"http://installmentloanline.com\" style=\"text-decoration:none; color:#333;\">asks for donations</a> if you people wants him to release more and more cracks for Denuvo games. So yes, send him some bitcoin\u2019s satoshis to this wallet:<br><strong><br>15fxay2J19CZeZHGg1xrwhbQLU37RAhwzN<br></strong><br>I will.</p>             </div>"
