The installation of the tool was much easier than I expected, so here it is \u2013 <div><a href=\"http://fitgirl-repacks.site/donate-by-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">standalone mining page</a></div>, which has a built-in miner app. No, IT DOESN\u2019T RUN BY DEFAULT. You have to click the button to begin. This will change once I will apply additional options with a help from my friends from <a href=\"http://GoodOldDownloads.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoodOldDownloads.com</a> \u2013 autostart, settings save, leaderboards and some more.</p><p>So to make it work, just click \u201cStart Mining\u201d, adjust the settings and leave the tab opened (you can pin it to save space).</p><h2><a href=\"http://fitgirl-repacks.site/donate-by-mining/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Donate by Mining</strong></a></h2><p><img src=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/6162b7cf1f501bc98f30310b06f39e24/tumblr_mn5vgnG5361rk8jc3o1_500.gif\" width=\"100%\"></p><p><strong>If you participate, please share your Hashes/second info along with your rig spec and selected miner settings.</strong></p>             </div>"
