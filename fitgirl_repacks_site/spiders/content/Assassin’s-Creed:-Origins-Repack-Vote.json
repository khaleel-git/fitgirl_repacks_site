Yesterday CODEX scene group released a CrackFix, which should be used by people, for whom the first crack didn\u2019t work. For me the new crackfix works in Windows 10, but still doesn\u2019t work in Windows 7. I also see same \u201ccrash\u201d reports in CrackWatch Reddit. I don\u2019t know if this crackfix is the last one from CODEX and if it will be ever updated again with the next crackfix. So, here\u2019s the poll.</p><p>Mind you, that in case you vote pro posting, I will save links to original CPY repack in case the new repack won\u2019t work for you either with initial CODEX crack or their crackfix.</p><div data-opinionstage-embed-url=\"https://www.opinionstage.com/api/v1/polls/2523782/code.json?width=\" style=\"display: none; visibility: hidden;\"></div>             </div>"
