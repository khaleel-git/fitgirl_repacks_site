I\u2019ve checked his latest reupload of NFS Payback and it really has my modified setup.exe, which install some malware and miner on your PC. Thanks to Javier Ju\u00e1rez for pointing that out.</p><p>I\u2019ve also checked a couple of older re-uploads, they came clear, but it doesn\u2019t mean all of them are.</p><p>I\u2019ve deleted all links to that site and will ban anyone posting them in the future. Beware, Games4Up is a malware distributor. Spread the word.</p><p>If you ever downloaded something from that site, check your PC with some good scanner. I\u2019d recommend free Dr.Web, AdAware and similar tools.</p>             </div>"
