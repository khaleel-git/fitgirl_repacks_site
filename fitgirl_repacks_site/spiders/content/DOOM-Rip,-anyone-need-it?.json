But I was asked in comments to original DOOM repack, if I should make the ripped version of the game without multiplayer and snapmap (maps editor). If I do it, it will be the smallest rip available, of course. But should I put my time in it?</p><p>Vote now!</p>[democracy id=\u201d5\u2033]<p>PS: Language packs for the rip (if it happens) will be compatible with original full repack.<br>PPS: All 3 repacks listed in \u201cComing soon\u201d will be published today. They all are ready and making final test runs.</p><p>OK, so be the DOOM rip.</p>             </div>"
