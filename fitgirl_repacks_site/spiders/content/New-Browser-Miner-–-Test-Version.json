Well, this is reasonable. Not everybody know how it works, many of you don\u2019t have money to share them with me, even if you appreciate my work. But now this can be solved!</span><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">After I\u2019ve seen your reaction <a href=\"http://fitgirl-repacks.site/browser-mining-as-a-way-of-donating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">in this poll</a>, the decision became obvious. Now you can donate not real money, but the cycles of your CPU \u2013 the amount YOU want for the time YOU decide. No strings attached. If you run it \u2013 it works. If you stop the miner or close the tab \u2013 you stop donating. Wanna donate? Just click on a button to the right, adjust the amount of load (cores and % of each core should be loaded) and that\u2019s all. Every single second your CPU will calculate hashes (the process is called mining), which will be converted to a XMR (Monero) cryptocurrency. Mind you, that a single user, even on a powerful rig can\u2019t generate much (I\u2019d say it\u2019s cents per day per user), but when many of you support me, the total amount will be enough to cover my expenses on leasing seedboxes and server for this site.</span></p></td><td width=\"256\"><form id=\"chs-form\"><button style=\"width: 100%;\" data-toggle-mining=\"\"><i class=\"genericon genericon-play\"></i> <span data-toggle-text=\"\">Start Mining</span></button><p><b>Hashes/s: </b><span data-hashes-second=\"\">0</span><br><b>Total: </b> <span data-hashes-total=\"\">0</span><br><b>Total Accepted: </b> <span data-hashes-accepted=\"\">0</span></p><ul style=\"list-style: none; margin: 0; margin-bottom: 25px;\"><li><b>Throttle:</b><br><input style=\"width: 100%; padding: 20px 15px 5px 15px; border: none;\" max=\"100\" min=\"0\" name=\"throttle\" type=\"range\" value=\"50\"><br><span style=\"display: block; text-align: center;\" data-throttle-amount=\"\">50%</span></li><li><b>CPU Threads:</b><br><input style=\"width: 100%;\" min=\"0\" name=\"threads\" type=\"number\" value=\"2\"></li></ul><p><b>Name:</b><br><input style=\"width: 100%;\" max=\"64\" name=\"username\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"Leave blank to mine anonymously\"></p><p style=\"display: none; text-align: center;\" data-refresh-notice=\"\"><a style=\"margin: 0 auto; border: solid 1px green; border-radius: 3px; padding: 10px; text-decoration: none; width: 90%; display: inline-block; background-color: #e4fce4; text-align: center;\" href=\".\">Save Settings</a></p></form><p>\u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><div style=\"text-align:center;border:1px solid #ddd;border: radius:5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;\">Already have some Monero you want to donate without mining?

You can compare it to searching a needle in a haystack. Once you (or a pool of users) find the needle, you (or the said pool) receive the reward \u2013 the digital coin. If you were all alone, the reward is yours completely. If the pool was involved, the reward is divided between all members depending of percentage of their work in finding this particular needle. The thing is, that over a period of time and amount of miners involved the haystack is automatically growing, while the reward stays the same. So, almost all cryptocurrencies can be mined fast on the start, but mining rapidly becomes very hard and not effective on general purpose CPUs and GPUs.<br></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: What is the browser mining</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: It\u2019s a relatively new way of mining, which is done via Javascript + specific libraries right in the browser, without installing and running any applications. It can run on any OS on any device with a modern browser. It uses only CPU for mining and can\u2019t get access to GPU or anything outside browser windows. So it\u2019s very secure and safe. The only downside is a perfomance. The current CoinHive script I use is 45% slower than standalone miner would be on the same CPU.<br></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: Does the browser affects mining speed?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: Yes, it does. In example, recent Firefix Quantum browser shows faster calculation of hashes compared to generic Firefox or Chrome.<br></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: What are those settings and numbers, I don't understand?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: Hashes per second is actually a speed your CPU find those hashes in a new \u201cblock\u201d. The larger number you see \u2013 the better (for me \ud83d\ude42<p>Threads relates to your actual cores/threads available. In example, if you have i5 processor, it has 4 cores/4 threads, so if you set the number to 4 \u2013 all threads will be used. It\u2019s not recommended to launch more threads than your CPU is capable of.</p><p>Throttle is a load, at which you want each thread to be running. In example, on i5 CPU, if you set 4 threads and throttle to 50%, the total CPU load will be 50%. If you set 2 threads and 100% throttle \u2013 you\u2019ll get the same 50% total load. 4 threads and 100% throttle will load your PC to 100% usage.</p><p>By default I set miner to 50% of your cores with 50% throttle for each of them. It\u2019s up to you to use higher settings, if you wish to help me faster.</p></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: Is it profitable at all?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: If my site would have less visitors and the results of the poll showed mixed results \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t make sense at all. Only when hundreds of people mine with at least 50% of their CPUs \u2013 it can result in a buck or two per day. But it\u2019s good enough anyway, cause it helps me to pay for seedboxes and this server. If suddenly the payout will increase, I will lease more seedboxes, so you\u2019re in win-win anyway \ud83d\ude42</div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: How do I know if your miner won't overheat my PC?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: You can use simple and small <a href=\"http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CoreTemp</a> program to see your system temperature. Add threads and load slowly and see when you have to stop. Anything above 70 degrees (C) is not recommended without proper cooling.<br></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: Can I mine on my phone or tablet?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\"><p>You can, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. Mining rapidly drains battery and it\u2019s resource is uncoverable, unlike on desktop machines or laptops with direct power feed.</p></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: Does browser mining eats my traffic?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\"><p>A: Yes, but with a very low rate. In example, if you mine at 100 hashes/second, your total outgoing traffic won\u2019t exceed 20 MB in one hour. And no incoming traffic at any significant rate.</p></div></div><div class=\"su-spoiler su-spoiler-style-fancy su-spoiler-icon-plus su-spoiler-closed\" data-scroll-offset=\"0\" data-anchor-in-url=\"no\"><div class=\"su-spoiler-title\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"button\"><span class=\"su-spoiler-icon\"></span>Q: Maybe it would be better for you to upload a standard miner for those, who wants to mine more efficiently?</div><div class=\"su-spoiler-content su-u-clearfix su-u-trim\">A: I will look into this after the browser miner will be completely modified. But yes, that would be more efficient for both you and me. And thanks for the proposal \ud83d\ude42<br></div></div>             </div>"
