In the West, the reception of the series was warm, especially in the United Kingdom. British critics have pointed out that the creators of the series have treated the original source with due care and respect, and have successfully transferred the atmosphere of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle\u2019s works. In 2006, Vasily Livanov became an Honorary MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) for his masterful portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Livanov\u2019s wax statue is displayed in the Sherlock Holmes museum in London. In 2007, a statue to Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, as played by Livanov and Solomin, was erected in Moscow near the British embassy. </p><h2>Russian Movies Weekend #21</h2><p ><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQzOWQ4OWYtYWY3YS00MmM1LThjY2ItYTFjOTg0YjU5NTViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ0MTY3MQ@@._V1_.jpg\" width=\"150\"><br>Genres/Tags: <strong> Comedy, Crime, Mystery</strong><br>iMDB Rating: <strong>8.3 out of 10 (based on 7627 ratings)</strong><br>Director: <strong> Igor Maslennikov</strong><br>Starring: <strong> Vasiliy Livanov, Vitali Solomin, Rina Zelyonaya</strong><br>Video format: <strong>YouTube</strong><br>Languages: <strong>Russian Audio, English subtitles</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Description</h3><p>The life of entire statistical bureau becomes crazy when an ordinary worker, a shy man, falls in love with a boss, a strict woman.</p><h3>Watch (All 7 episodes in a row)</h3><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbW2SJ0Kf8I\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><a href=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/category/russian-movies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u2665 Previously on \u201cRussian Movies Weekend\u201d</a></span></p>             </div>"
