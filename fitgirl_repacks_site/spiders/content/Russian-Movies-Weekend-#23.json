That\u2019s why today\u2019s Russian Movies Weekend is devoted to the largest war in humanity\u2019s history.</p><p>The first movie is relatively old, it\u2019s from 1985 and it\u2019s one of the hardest flicks I ever watched. But it\u2019s the movie every person should watch to the end. Just come and see.</p><p>The second one is a modern one, only 5 years old \u2013 and it tries to show the war from the woman\u2019s point of view \u2013 and via the rifle\u2019s scope. And it\u2019s based on a true story.</p><h2>Russian Movies Weekend #23</h2><p ><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4Njg0NTAtYjI5Ny00ZjAxLTkwNmItZTMxMWU5M2U3M2RjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkwMjQ5NzM@._V1_SX651_CR0,0,651,999_AL_.jpg\" width=\"150\"><br>Genres/Tags: <strong>  Drama, War</strong><br>iMDB Rating: <strong>8.3 out of 10 (based on 50202 ratings)</strong><br>Director: <strong> Elem Klimov</strong><br>Starring: <strong> Aleksey Kravchenko, Olga Mironova, Liubomiras Laucevicius</strong><br>Video format: <strong>YouTube</strong><br>Languages: <strong>Russian Audio, English subtitles</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Description</h3><p>After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet resistance movement against ruthless German forces and experiences the horrors of World War II.</p><h3>Watch</h3><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UkkJZweYaLI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><h3><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>Battle for Sevastopol / Bitva za Sevastopol / \u0411\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u0421\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c</strong> (2015)</span></h3><p ><img class=\"alignleft\" src=\"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUxNTk4ZjktM2YzOC00NjM4LThmODMtNWUyZjU3MzJkYzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzcwMTc0Mg@@._V1_SY1000_SX750_AL_.jpg\" width=\"150\"><br>Genres/Tags: <strong> Biography, Drama, Romance</strong><br>iMDB Rating: <strong>7.1 out of 10 (based on 9634 ratings)</strong><br>Director: <strong> Sergey Mokritskiy</strong><br>Starring: <strong> Yuliya Peresild, Evgeniy Tsyganov, Oleg Vasilkov</strong><br>Video format: <strong>TubiTV</strong><br>Languages: <strong>Russian Audio, English subtitles</strong></p><p>\u00a0</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Battle for Sevastopol is a 2015 biographical war film about Lyudmila Pavlichenko, a young Soviet woman who joined the Red Army to fight the Nazi invasion of the USSR and became one of the deadliest snipers in World War II.
