In my post back then I\u2019ve asked the two guys from the team \u2013 RAVEN and KNIGHT to return. And now they did!</p><p>Welcome a new repacking team \u2013 APEX. Yeah, just like the game \ud83d\ude42</p><p><a href=\"https://teamapex.site/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/22.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"837\" height=\"201\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14687\" srcset=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/22.png 837w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/22-300x72.png 300w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/22-768x184.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px\"></a></p><p>Remember, those are no noobs, both RAVEN and KNIGHT know their shit and were never caught in something bad while being in CorePack. So you can trust them just like you trust me.</p><p>They have a good, clean site without advertising, shitty ad-shorteners, direct links and torrents. Also, take a look at their custom installer!</p><p><a href=\"https://teamapex.site/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Installer.tmp_ES2fT9elyj.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14688\" srcset=\"https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Installer.tmp_ES2fT9elyj.png 960w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Installer.tmp_ES2fT9elyj-300x169.png 300w, https://fitgirl-repacks.site/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Installer.tmp_ES2fT9elyj-768x432.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\"></a></p><p>They already have some repacks uploaded, so go and check.</p><p>As for me \u2013 I\u2019m very happy to see those guys back, competition is very much needed in our \u201cscene\u201d and APEX will bring it.</p><p><a style=\"font-size:30px\" href=\"https://teamapex.site\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://teamapex.site</a></p>             </div>"
